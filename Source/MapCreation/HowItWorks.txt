How to create a world using a text file:

The name of the text file (without the extension) is the name of the world.

Each world is composed of a positive number of maps, which may correspond to floors in a dungeon for example.

The first line contains the number of maps in the world.

The following lines, up to the line containing ###, are the header.
They contain information on the different types of objects or entities that can be found in the world.
For each of these lines (if it isn't just blank space), the first character encodes the type of object/entity, the second is the identifier, and what follows is an encoding of the additional information.

After the line containing ###, each map is described one by one.

The first line of each map description must be ##.

The second line in the description of a map is an integer containing the positive number of rooms.

After this, each room is described one by one.

Each room is described as follows:
 - The first line contains #.
 - The second line contains two integers: the width and the height of the room.
 - After this, each line in the text file represents a line in the room.
 - Every three characters encode one block in the room.
 - Of the three characters, the first encodes the type of block,
   the second the type of object/entity that is on that block,
   the third is an optional identifier for that object/entity (which has a different function depending on the object/entity).
 - The different characters that can encode types of blocks are :
   - ' ' : empty block.
   - 'w' : wall block.
   - 'f' : floor block.
   - 's' : stone wall block
 - The different characters that can encode objects/entities are :
   - ' ' : no object or entity.
   - 'p' : player starts on this block.
   - '!' : block from which a player can warp. The coordinates of the block to which the player warps is described in the header, on a line starting with '!' followed by the identifier, and then the integers representing map number, room number, x coordinate, y coordinate. 
   - 'k' : key, that unlocks doors having the same identifier.
   - 'd' : door, that can be unlocked with a key having the same identifier.
   - 'm' : monster, information about the type of monster should be written in the header, on a line starting with m followed by the identifier.
   - 'c' : chest, information about the contents of the chest should be written in the header, on a line starting with c followed by the identifier.

The format can be summarised as follows:

*Contents of NameOfWorld.txt (or other extension)*
Number of maps

Information pertaining to objects and entities.
