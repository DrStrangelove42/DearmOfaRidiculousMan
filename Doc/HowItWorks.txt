How to create a world using a text file:

The name of the text file (without the extension) is the name of the world.

Each world is composed of a positive number of maps, which may correspond to floors in a dungeon for example.

The first line contains the number of maps in the world.

In the following lines, each map is described one by one.

The first line of each map description must be ##.

The second line in the description of a map is an integer containing the positive number of rooms.

After this, each room is described one by one.

Each room is described as follows:
 - The first line contains #.
 - The second line contains two integers: the width and the height of the room.
 - The third line contains two integers describing the absolute position (coordinates x and y) of the room.
 - After this, the lines up to the next one containing # contain information on the different types of objects or entities that are in the room.
   For each of these lines (if it isn't just blank space), the first character encodes the type of object/entity, the second is the identifier, and what follows is an encoding of the additional information.
 - After the line containing #, the layout of the room is described.
 - Every three characters encode one block in the room.
 - Of the three characters, the first encodes the type of block,
   the second the type of object/entity that is on that block,
   the third is an optional identifier for that object/entity (which has a different function depending on the object/entity).
 - The different characters that can encode types of blocks are:
   - ' ' : empty block.
   - 'w' : wall block.
   - 'f' : floor block.
   - 's' : stone wall block
 - The different characters that can encode objects/entities are:
   - ' ' : no object or entity.
   - 'p' : player starts on this block.
   - '!' : block from which a player can warp. The coordinates of the block to which the player warps is described in the header, on a line starting with '!' followed by the identifier, and then the integers representing map number, room number, x coordinate, y coordinate, the delay, separated by spaces. 
   - 'k' : key, the following character is the identifier.
   - 'd' : door that can be unlocked with a key. The characteristics of the door are described in the header, on a line starting with d followed by the identifier of the door, a space, the identifier of the key that unlocks it, and then the direction the door faces when it's open and when it's closed, no spaces.
   - 'm' : monster, information about the type of monster should be written in the header, on a line starting with m followed by the identifier.
   - 'c' : chest, information about the contents of the chest should be written in the header, on a line starting with c followed by the identifier.

The format can be summarised as follows:
